Things to understand before going INTO your exam

* Don't even think, immediately ensure that you have [Auto Complete and Alias's](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) set up for speedy typing of commands. kubectl create can be a bitch when you're on a time limit.
* Ensure that you have a mouse with you for faster COPY/PASTE actions during the exam. Don't count on the key commands as they are different with the Virtual Machine given to you. 
* You will NOT be able to have a browser with preorganized bookmarks. There will be a virtual desktop that you can access to dive into the kubernetes documentation page.
* Speed is the key, there is no time to get lost in a question. Look at each question and make the ones you think will take longer than two min to fix.
* When you move to a new question, ensure that you IMMEDIATELY switch contexts. From there, read the entire question as sometimes they will provide a pre-filled out template at the very bottom of the page. 
* To edit any pod that's running, copy the contents of the active pod, then paste to a new Yaml file and create. 
* Understand that because time is NOT on your side, you will need to cut corners for deploying/editing cluster info. Because of this, I encourage you to learn more Imperial Commands which you can reference the official kubernetes guide [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#run). 



Common Commands to Know going in to any CK[A/S/D]


## Cluster Setup



## Cluster Hardening
Default location for the Kubelet file:
/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml


## System Hardening
[_AppArmor_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/apparmor/)
Default directory for profiles:
/etc/apparmor.d/

Commands to know: [Also helpful here](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/security-apparmor)
$ aa-status
  -Will show all the profiles loaded into the application


[Seccomp](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/)
Used to white list or block all syscalls
Default profile location: /var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/profiles/


## Minimize Microservice Vulnerabilities



## Supply Chain Security




## Monitoring, Logging, and Runtime Securtiy
Three things will be on your exam. Don't skirt learning this as you will need to activate these on three different questions, Falco, AppArmor, Kubernetes Auditing.

[_Falco_](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/)
* Core config yaml file is located in /etc/falco/falco.yaml
You will use the falco.yaml file to list the different rules files you need loaded and enforced with Falco.
Output can be saved in JSON or text, if the _json_output_ is set to false, then output is saved as text.

* /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml is the default file to list all of the rules you want to be used in Falco.

* In order to see events generated by Falco is to run the _journalctl -u falco_ command.


[Enable Auditing](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/)
* Make sure to make a copy of the Kube API yaml file (ex. /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-api.yaml) as you messing with this will likely result in kubectl not working anymore. Save your sanity by making a copy, and re-applying when you get too frustrated.

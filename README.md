##Things to understand before going INTO your exam
-You will NOT be able to have a browser with preorganized bookmarks. There will be a virtual desktop that you can access to dive into the kubernetes documentation page.
-Speed is the key, there is no time to get lost in a question. Look at each question and make the ones you think will take longer than two min to fix.
